# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Page Replacement Algorithms](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms) <br>
Page Replacement Algorithm decides which page to remove, also called swap out when a new page needs to be loaded into the main memory. Page Replacement happens when a requested page is not present in the main memory and the available space is not sufficient for allocation to the requested page.
	
2. [Beladys Anomaly](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-beladys-anomaly) <br>
The rate of page faults varies directly with the number of frames allocated to the individual process. The increase in the number of frames considerably decreases the number of page faults. However, sometimes reverse action occurs when the increased number of frames results in increased page faults. This exception is known as the Beladys Anomaly.
	
3. [Allocation of frames ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/) <br>
An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Demand paging necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a frame allocation algorithm. Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process.
	
4. [NUMA](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/NUMA-non-uniform-memory-access) <br>
NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded. NUMA is used in a symmetric multiprocessing ( SMP ) system. 
	
5. [Memory-mapped IO vs Port-mapped IO](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Embedded/memory_mapped_io_vs_port_mapped_isolated_io.php) <br>
Microprocessors normally use two methods to connect external devices: memory mapped or port mapped I/O. However, as far as the peripheral is concerned, both methods are really identical. The difference between the two schemes occurs within the microprocessor. Intel has, for the most part, used the port mapped scheme for their microprocessors and Motorola has used the memory mapped scheme.
	
6. [Techniques to handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/) <br>
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. Here you'll find techniques to handle Trashing!
	
7. [Page Buffering Algorithm](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~yairamir/cs418/os6/tsld025.htm) <br>
The operating system maintains a pool of free frames. When a page fault occurs, a page is selected for replacement and written into the pool of free frames. The faulty page is swapped out of disk and the page table is modified.
	
8. [Demand Paging](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gkesden/ucsd/classes/sp16/cse120-a/applications/ln/lecture13.html) <br>
Demand Paging is like simple paging and swapping all rolled up into one. We consider the page to be the unit of I/O. Instead of swapping all of the pages at once when a context-switch occurs, we defer loading or storing any page until it becomes absolutely necessary.
	
9. [Logical and Physical Address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/) <br>
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address.Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address.
	
10. [Page Fault](https://techterms.com/definition/page_fault) <br>
A page fault occurs when a program attempts to access a block of memory that is not stored in the physical memory, or RAM. The fault notifies the operating system that it must locate the data in virtual memory, then transfer it from the storage device, such as an HDD or SSD, to the system RAM.
